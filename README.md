🏥 ER Wait Time Analysis with Matplotlib
📌 Project Overview

Emergency rooms operate in high-pressure environments where time directly affects patient outcomes and satisfaction.

In this project, I analyzed 5,000 emergency room visits to understand:

What drives longer wait times

Whether urgent patients are prioritized

How wait times impact patient satisfaction

When ER congestion is highest

The goal was to turn data into insights that could support better hospital operations and patient experience.

📊 Dataset

Emergency Room Visit Dataset (5,000 records)

Includes urgency levels, staffing ratios, wait times, and satisfaction scores

Simulates real hospital operational data

🎯 Business Questions

This analysis answers:

Are critical patients prioritized?

Do longer waits reduce patient satisfaction?

When are ERs most congested?

Does staffing influence wait time?

📈 Key Visualizations

✔ Wait Time by Urgency Level
✔ Wait Time vs Patient Satisfaction
✔ Wait Time vs Nurse-to-Patient Ratio
✔ Wait Time Distribution by Time of Day

All visualizations were created using Matplotlib.

🔍 Key Insights

✅ Triage works: Critical patients have the shortest waits, indicating effective prioritization.

✅ Wait time matters: Patient satisfaction declines as wait time increases.

✅ Evenings are busiest: Higher variability and longer median waits suggest peak congestion.

✅ Staffing impacts flow: Nurse-to-patient ratios influence how long patients wait.

💡 Why This Matters

Reducing ER wait times can:

Improve patient satisfaction

Increase hospital efficiency

Support better resource planning

Enhance quality of care

Small operational improvements can lead to meaningful patient experience gains.
